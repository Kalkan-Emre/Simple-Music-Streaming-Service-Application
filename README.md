# CENG213_Programming_Assignment1
**Objectives:**</br>
*In this programming assignment, you are first expected to implement a circular doubly linked list data structure, in which
each node will contain the data and two pointers to the previous and the next nodes. The linked list data structure will
include a head pointer that points to the first node of the linked list. The details of the structure are explained further
in the following sections. Then, you will use this specialized linked list structure to implement a simple music streaming
service application.*
